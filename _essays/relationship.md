I have devised a Unified Purpose Vector Framework in my quest to understand relationships. 

The URF consists of these components
+ Purpose vector (P): what an agent wants to achieve.
+ Resource Vector (R): what an agent can offer or deploy to achieve purposes.
+ Purpose Alignment Vector (PAV): quantifies how well the purposes of two agents are satisfied by their available resources.

For any two agents A and B: <br>
PAV=(R<sub>A</sub>​⋅P<sub>B</sub>​)+(R<sub>B</sub>​⋅P<sub>A</sub>​)

*Note- The UPVF assumes that what someone can give and what someone wants can be mapped onto the same domain of meaning. A more nuanced understanding could use a learned transformation to map between them.*

**Relationship Types (Unified Mathematics)**

Transactional Relationships

+ Purpose vectors P<sub>A</sub> and P<sub>B</sub> are distinct and complementary.
+ Each agent offers resources aligned with the other’s purposes.
+ The relationship optimizes mutual utility through purpose diversity.
+ Maximize: ∣R<sub>A</sub>​⋅P<sub>B</sub>​∣+∣R<sub>B</sub>​⋅P<sub>A</sub>​​∣

Non-Transactional Relationships (NTR)

+ Same mathematics as TR, but purpose vectors converge:
P<sub>A</sub>→P<sub>shared</sub>←P<sub>B</sub>
+ Stability depends on sustained purpose fusion rather than exchange balance.
