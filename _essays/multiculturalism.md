A new custom or culture adds to what I call ‘cultural stress’ on a society. This stress can be social or economic. The pre-existing culture is built on decades or centuries of developing a social contract to manage trade-offs for its cultural stress. When someone introduces a new custom or culture, it creates a need to redefine this contract, that is what multiculturalism is. 

But when a society is too flexible with its social contract, it will inevitably be overwritten by the most dominant culture. The problem with this is that it guarantees the death of a unique culture, with its own features and beauty, by shutting off the life support that was the social contract of its native society.
