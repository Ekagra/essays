Money is the sustainer of art. It was probably the friend of the first man who invented fire, not the inventor himself, who learned his art and traded it for resources. Maybe he cooked the hunts of others in exchange for food, tools or shelter. Later, the artist who learned to control fire for pottery, cooking or metalwork could trade those creations for what they needed to live.

Art takes time, skill and materials, which are all forms of labor. If there is no value proposition to art, there is no way to trade that labor required to create the art. It is the same with the idea of “do what you love so work does not feel like labor (grindy part).” You might love the work, but you will not love the obstacles that get in the way of it. Either someone invests in your work to help remove those obstacles, expecting a return that creates tradable value for others, or you sell that value directly to the people. Either way, money becomes part of the equation. 

Humans are social beings. If I am creating value for many, I expect recognition and some social standing for self-respect, and money is the clearest signal of that. Without it, most artists would spend their days making a living instead of creating.
